This is a placeholder file for the Open Graph image.

To complete the social media sharing functionality, you need to:

1. Create a PNG image with dimensions 1200x630 pixels
2. The image should showcase your MentorPath application
3. Include your logo, app name, and key features
4. Save it as 'og-image.png' in the public folder

You can:
- Take a screenshot of your dashboard
- Use design tools like Canva, Figma, or Photoshop
- Create a professional banner with your branding

The image will be automatically used when someone shares your app link on:
- LinkedIn
- Twitter
- Facebook
- WhatsApp
- Other social platforms

This ensures rich previews with your app's visual identity!
